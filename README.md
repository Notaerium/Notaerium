- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Notaerium or Vinh PARNEIX by government name.
-  I am a French guy who has been interested in dev and web dev for a while, and while exploring other horizons, I couldn't forget about this passion I had.
-  I have already done some studies on embedded programming a few years ago, but now I am going forward with the web approach.
-  So here I am, learning web dev and having fun creating apps!
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in both Front and Back-end. I love creating beautiful and practical apps and love to communicate with databases.
- For now, I am using PHP, JEE, JS, HTML/CSS (I mean of course), and a bit of Python and I have been using Symfony and React as frameworks,
- but I will continue to learn things such as Django or Spring, and other javascript frameworks such as Vue.js or Angular. I am also getting some knowledge of AWS and cloud computing.
- ðŸŒ± One of the things I love about this job is that there is always something new to learn, being a new tech, a new framework, or a whole new language.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: parneix.vinh@gmail.com
